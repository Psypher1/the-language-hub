## Introduction

> Arabic (اَلْعَرَبِيَّة, al-ʿarabiyyah [alʕaraˈbijːah]; عَرَبِيّ, ʿarabī [ˈʕarabiː] or [ʕaraˈbij]) is a Semitic language spoken primarily across the Arab world.[14] Having emerged in the first millennium BC, it is named after the Arab people; the term "Arab" was initially used to describe those living in the Arabian Peninsula, as perceived by geographers from ancient Greece.

Unlike most other languages, Arabic is wriiten from right to left.

مرحبًاj and it is prnounced
**mrhban**
