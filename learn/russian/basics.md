## Introduction

> Russian (русский язык, tr. russkiy yazyk) is an East Slavic language native to Russia in Eastern Europe. It is he most spoken Slavic language.  
> The beauty of Russian is that you pronounce what you read.

The Russian language looks complicated at first glance. But most of that has to do with its alphabet. We'll get that out of the way first.

## Additonal Info

Now that we have covered the alphabet and pronunciation, let's look at some additional things to help on your Russian learning journey.

In Russian, there is no verb "to be". You directly link to the noun or profession
So instead of I am a doctor,we say I doctor.

Let's look at what would be subject pronouns in English:

| Russian | English      | Usage                     | Translation          |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Я       | I            | Я ДОКТОР                  | I am a doctor        |
| ТЫ      | You          | ТЫ СТУДЕНТ                | You are a student    |
| ОН      | He           | ОН МУЖЧИНА                | He is a man          |
| ОН**А** | She          | ОНА ЖЕНЩИНА               | She is a woman       |
| ОН**О** | It           | \*Used in a different way |
| МЫ      | We           | МЫ УЧИТЕЛЯ                | We are teachers      |
| ВЫ      | You (plural) | ВЫ КОСМОНАВТ              | You are an astronaut |
| OН**И** | They         | ОНИ ДЕТИ                  | they are children    |

> We wll look at how ОН**О** is used a little later.
